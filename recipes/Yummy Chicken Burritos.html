<h2>Description</h3>
    <p>
        I used to beg my mom for these; now I make them for my son. Serve with beans, tomatoes, lettuce, sour cream, salsa, and cheese.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with habanero peppers (such as RO*TELÂ® Hot)</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>3 jalapeno chile peppers, seeded and diced</li>
        <li>2 (1 ounce) packets taco seasoning mix, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons canola oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) package flour tortillas</li>
    
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken, tomatoes with habanero peppers, green bell pepper, onion, jalapeno chile peppers, and 1 packet taco seasoning in a large pot; pour in enough water to just cover chicken.
        </li>
        <li>Bring chicken and vegetables to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink inside, about 1 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the pot and let cool. Pull chicken meat off the bones and cut into bite-sized pieces; discard carcass. Pour off about half the liquid from the pot, making sure all the vegetables stay. Return chicken meat to pot; add the remaining 1 packet taco seasoning. Simmer until flavors have blended, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry tortillas, working in batches, in the hot oil until desired crispness is reached, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Spoon chicken mixture into each tortilla to serve.
